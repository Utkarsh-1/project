# About Project

Heya, Welcome to my repository for projects which I have completed and which I am working on. Side Projects are also added here which are not under affiliation with my institute - Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad. Projects are credited every semester for 3 years as a part of my degree requirements.

## List of Projects

#### Current Projects 

1. **Image segmentation and graph cuts**

#### Past Projects

1. **Detection of rotation of convex object using 8 directional Chain Code**
  
  *Under mentorship of **Dr. Sushanta Mukhopadhyay**, Associate Professor, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad*

**Abstract**: Developed an algorithm using directional Freeman Chain Code of Eight Directions. Implementation in C (C11) programming language used two input files (from same directory) and outputs to console whether the objects are rotations of other.
Test files, implemented code, report, presentation of the project is avilable at: [`https://github.com/madhur4127/project/tree/master/ChainCode`](https://github.com/madhur4127/project/tree/master/ChainCode)
